# Restroom-for-specially-challenged
Finding accessible restrooms when one is away from one's familiar surroundings can be
difficult for people with disabilities The traditional restroom finders' doesnâ€™t provide the
comprehensive and user-friendly solution that can address the issues effectively such as
accessibility features, different kinds of navigators, which causes Individuals with physical
disabilities to experience unnecessary discomfort, inconvenience, and stress. They are often
out-dated or not user- friendly. The web application we develop will address the issues such
as accessibility details, user ratings, types of navigator and finding the route through all
types of transportation (car, bus, cycle and walk). For the sake of inclusivity and to ensure a
higher standard of living, a dedicated solution that is tailored to the requirements of this
group is necessary.
